## This project is being implemented as a project that includes all the spring microservices, cloud, messaging systems that I have learned about.

### Project almost done. I am working on the following, this is a last part of the big picture:
Vault Service - Vault is a secure, flexible, and easy-to-use key-value store. It is a tool for storing secrets, configuration, and other data in a highly encrypted and protected way.


***Percentage of progress : 95%***
